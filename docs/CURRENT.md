# Current work

Active milestone: [M6 — Album Player](milestones/M6-album-player.md)

The current task is M6 slice 3: adopt and connect public policy commands/state,
album/shuffle navigation and the media-policy port, then history/settings and
mock UI/input behavior through injected ports, around the
[Core transport](../specs/playback-transport-v1.md),
[schema 2 ingress](../specs/player-command-v2.md) and
[published state](../specs/player-state-v2.md).
The internal transport now handles asynchronous preparation/reset/start/pause/
resume, cancellation, fault priority and deadlines with scripted host ports.
The public state publisher copies selection metadata, committed position,
pending operations and errors without polling audio or depending on UI reads.
PlayerSession connects the seven public transport commands with a 32-command
queue, 64-result replay window and shared projection/execution validation.
Submission and public reads perform no playback-port calls; publication can
be skipped without changing control work. Library/backend changes after
admission interrupt the batch as an asynchronous failure.
The MDX engine now exposes [sequencing progress](../specs/mdx-progress-v1.md):
checked TrackLoop counts and whole-FM-tick aggregation at the write timestamp.
This is read-ahead progress. The [media loop envelope](../specs/media-loop-envelope-v1.md)
consumes explicitly mapped progress intervals at audio-frame boundaries and
implements live repeat decisions, fade/restoration and paused sample ownership.
The real audible mapping, public policy ingress and sound adapter remain to be wired.
See M6 for the executed checks; this does not establish a working Pocket audio
adapter, playback policy, complete UI or completion of slice 3.
Use the [transition proposal](design/pocket-player-transition-contract.md),
preserve v1 compatibility and adopt each contract before its implementation.
Slices 1–2 implement [host metadata](../specs/host-metadata-v1.md),
[ALBM storage](../specs/album-catalog-v1.md),
[folder ingestion](../specs/album-ingestion-v1.md) and
[Core-owned catalog pages](../specs/catalog-query-v1.md). Windows host checks,
focused Linux sanitizer tests and the catalog RISC-V link probe passed; see the
milestone for exact evidence. These are not M6 playback/UI/hardware acceptance.
The [accepted Q1–Q24 requirements](design/pocket-library-player-spec-draft.md)
define the intended album player; do not reopen settled product questions.
Continue through the milestone's host-verifiable slices until a concrete
hardware check or an unresolved product decision requires the user.

[M5 evidence](milestones/M5-real-mdx-library-playback.md) remains preserved.
The user closed its investigation on 2026-09-12; M5 is deferred, not passed.
M6 explicitly owns the remaining timing/CDC, placement, APF failure/lifecycle
and future PCM/UI reserve gates. ADR-0008 production promotion remains gated.
No unrun APF2 hardware result becomes a pass by moving this pointer.

Use the active milestone's acceptance criteria and actual checks as the
completion authority. Update this pointer and milestone evidence when a slice
advances; do not duplicate historical diagnostic instructions here.
